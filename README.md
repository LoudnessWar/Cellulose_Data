This is a project I did for a friend. He was working with cellulose data, and the .dat files were not properly parsed.
There is a sample here of the cellulose data, but the actual set was much larger.

The main point of this project was to clean up the data for him and then search through all the folders.
He wanted me to create a csv that contained the mean and standard deviation of the different features in the data sets. 
This is what is done in DSI_GET and in Test4 in the tests folder.

Later, I was tasked with writing two more scripts that would get .dat files and put them into filtered folders. 
containing different csv's this is what is done in datatofiles; and another script to do the same thing but output it all into one csv done in datatofile.

I also did some feature analysis and regression on the data set to determine its usability and to have a basic understanding of the features importance.
The feature analysis was done using a Random Forset to understand the importance of the features. The regression was done using a simple multivariate linear regression model.

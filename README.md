"This is a project I did for a friend. He was working with Cellulose Data and the .dat files were not properly parsed.
There is a sample here of the Cellulose Data but the actual set was much larger.

The main point of this project was to clean up the data for him and then search through all the folders.
He wanted me to create a csv that contained the mean and standard deviation of the different features in the data sets. Which is what is done in DSI_GET and in Test4 in the tests folder.

Later I was tasked with writing another script for him that would get dat files and put them into filtered folders containing differnt csv's this is what is done in datatofiles
